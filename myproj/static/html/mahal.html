The original palace complex was four times bigger than the present structure. In its heyday, the palace was considered to be one of the wonders of the South. The palace is located two kilometres (1.2 mi) south east of the Meenakshi Amman Temple. <br> 
        After independence, the Thirumalai Palace was declared as a national monument and is now under the protection of the Tamil Nadu Archaeological Department. This palace is open for the visitors daily. Many films are shot in the Palace, primarily due to the large pillars present. Notable films are Maniratnam's "Bombay" ("Kannalane" song), "Guru" ("Tera Bina" Song) etc. Vikram starrer "Bheemaa" ("Ragasiya Kanavugal" song). The palace is well equipped to perform light and sound shows depicting the story of Silappathikaram both in Tamil and English language.
